### This meetup we met at West Side Charlies

###### Like our change from The Rocket to Jumping Bean we decided to change our bar scene this month and yet again get away from the downtown area. So, we met up at West Side Charlies on Kenmount Road. Here we had lots of parking and even got to use the back room for a bit of privacy/separation from the other occupants. This place shows promise as a longer term solution for our growing group and potential to hold talks.
